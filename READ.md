Project Name -  BLOOD CONNECT (Connecting Donors and Recipients to Save Lives).

 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Every second matters when a life is at risk. Yet, during medical emergencies, families often struggle to find a compatible blood donor on time. Panic, lack of information, and absence of a reliable system force people to depend on social media posts or personal contacts wasting precious time.
Many willing donors exist, but there is no fast and trusted platform that connects them instantly with those in need. This communication gap between donors and recipients continues to cost lives that could have been saved.
Our project aims to bridge this gap by creating a simple, reliable, and accessible platform that connects blood donors and recipients at the right moment  because no life should be lost due to a lack of timely blood support.

SOLUTION
The proposed system is a web-based platform designed to efficiently connect blood donors with recipients during emergency situations. It enables users to register as donors by providing essential details such as blood group and contact information.
The system allows quick searching and filtering of donors, reducing the time required to find compatible blood during critical moments. By digitizing and centralizing donor information, the platform minimizes manual effort, improves response time, and ensures reliable access to life-saving resources.
This solution combines technical simplicity with real-world impact, making the process of finding blood faster, more organized, and more accessible for everyone involved.
